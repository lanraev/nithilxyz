          <p>Who I am, how I think, and how I behave are shaped in large part by my neurodivergence. When I was 15, I was diagnosed with severe ADHD and OCD (DSM-5-TR). The latter is largely controllable—20mg of Fluoxetine per day over many months has proven effective. However, the effects of ADHD still permeate my day-to-day.</p>

          <p><em>Here's what that means for you:</em></p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>I might not respond to messages and e-mails for many days</strong>, despite having noticed (and even read) them. This isn't about you—it’s because I'm extremely unmotivated in this specific context at times. However, I will spontaneously strike up a conversation with you that might last hours.</li>
            <li><strong>If I ever seem uncharacteristically sombre and/or focused</strong>, I am likely on stimulants. I’m not sad unless I say I am. I’m not in a bad mood. I haven’t suddenly matured. I’m on Methylphenidate, which is the only stimulant available to me right now.</li>
            <li><strong>I will be unable to hold a linear conversation with you.</strong> It’s rare that I finish telling anyone about something before it trips off a memory of something else that's also super interesting, leading to the original discussion being abandoned and a tangential topic being pursued.</li>
            <li><strong>I will interrupt you—often.</strong> This is something I'm actively working on, and I would appreciate you stopping me in my tracks and calling me out on it.</li>
            <li><strong>I'll frequently lose my train of thought, even mid-sentence.</strong> You’ll notice I pause at seemingly random intervals while speaking—this is me trying to recall where I was going with what I'm saying.</li>
            <li><strong>You will also notice that I tend to throw myself headfirst into brand-new, divergent fields</strong> (unrelated to my experience, education, or training) every few months, seemingly abandoning a trajectory toward significant progress.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>The upside is that I've become a strong first-principles thinker. I do extremely well in high-intensity, fast-paced environments, and I’m adept at reasoning and making decisions with limited information.</p>

          <p>I’ll update this page as I learn more about myself.</p>
